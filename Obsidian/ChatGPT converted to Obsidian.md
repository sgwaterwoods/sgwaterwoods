When copy ChatGPT generated answer to Obsidian note, Latex formulas are not shown correctly. That is because ChatGPT uses different delimiters from Obsidian. 

To automatically replace LaTeX delimiters in an Obsidian file with simpler Markdown equivalents for mathematical expressions, we can use a combination of Obsidian plugins and JavaScript. 


Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on setting up a system to manually trigger these replacements:

### 1. Install Templater Plugin
First, ensure that the Templater plugin is installed and enabled:

1. Open Obsidian.
2. Go to `Settings` > `Community Plugins`.
3. Disable `Safe mode`.
4. Click `Browse` and search for "Templater".
5. Install the plugin and then enable it by toggling it on.

### 2. Create a Templater Script
Create a Templater script that you can run to replace the LaTeX delimiters:

1. Navigate to your designated `Templates` folder or any other folder you prefer.
2. Create a new note which will serve as your script, we name it "ChatGPT-2-Obsidian.md".
3. In the note, paste the following JavaScript code:
   ```javascript
   <%*
    // Get the current file's content
    let content = tp.file.content;
    
    // Define replacements according to your specifications
    const replacements = [
      { from: /\\\(\s/g, to: "$$" }, // Replaces "\( " (with following space)
      { from: /\s\\\)/g, to: "$$" }, // Replaces " \)" (with leading space)
      { from: /\\\(/g, to: "$$" },   // Replaces "\(" (without spaces)
      { from: /\\\)/g, to: "$$" },   // Replaces "\)" (without spaces)
      { from: /\\\[/g, to: "$$$$" },  // Replaces "\[" (without spaces)
      { from: /\\\]/g, to: "$$$$" }   // Replaces "\]" (without spaces)
    ];
    
    // Perform the replacements
    replacements.forEach(replacement => {
      content = content.replace(replacement.from, replacement.to);
    });
    
    // Update the file with the new content
    await this.app.vault.modify(this.app.workspace.activeLeaf.view.file, content);
    %>

   ```
4. Save the note.

### 3. Use the Templater Script
To use the script:

1. Open the note where you want to replace the LaTeX delimiters.
2. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`).
3. Type "Templater: Open Insert template Modal" and select it.
4. Choose the Templater Script you created, which is "ChatGPT-2-Obsidian" 
5. The script will replace the delimiters in the current note.

### Note:
- This script only works when manually triggered, which means you have to open the command palette and run the Templater script each time you want to perform the replacements.
- Be cautious with your regular expressions to avoid unintentional replacements.

### Alternative: Automate with Obsidian Plugins
If you frequently need to make these replacements, consider creating an Obsidian plugin or looking for community plugins that might handle text replacement more dynamically. This would involve some familiarity with JavaScript and the Obsidian API. You might also explore plugins like "Find and Replace" if they can be configured to meet your needs.

Using Templater for this task is a bit of a workaround, and for full automation, developing a custom plugin or script that listens for text changes and applies these transformations in real time would be the ideal solution.
